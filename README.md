# Baby Animal QuizApp
__Description:__ This is a simple quiz app that is not IE compatible. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I tried to make it as a11y compatible as possible.  

## Instructions:
Open `index.html` on your browser. Follow directions to fill out the quiz. For keyboard users, use the tab, arrow, and enter keys to navigate.
